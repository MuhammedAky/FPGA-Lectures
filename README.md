# FPGA Weekly Course Notes and Projects

Welcome to my FPGA learning journey! This repository contains my weekly notes and hands-on projects as I progress through an FPGA course. My goal is to document my learning, share example codes, and provide useful references for others interested in FPGA development.

## Contents
- **Weekly Notes (PDF)**: Structured lecture notes in PDF format.
- **Example Codes**: Verilog/VHDL implementations for exercises and projects.
- **Project Files**: Full FPGA projects with descriptions and setup instructions.

## Tools & Requirements
- **FPGA Development Board** (e.g., Xilinx, Intel, Lattice)
- **HDL Language**: Verilog / VHDL
- **Software**: Vivado, Quartus, or any other suitable FPGA toolchain
